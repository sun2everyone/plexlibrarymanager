# plexlibrarymanager
A web-based library manager for Plex Media Server, that helps organizing your media for plex to easily recognize it. 
It uses symlinks, so you don't have to rename and move your media files (which is especially useful, when you download them using torrents and whant to continue sharing them with others).

Current version designed specially for anime libraries. Multilanguage support (english and russian included). 

Support of other library and media types may be added in future. And no fancy UI yet.
